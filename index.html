        <h2 class = "responsive"><span> About </span></h2>
        <p class = "responsive"> 
            I am a Sophomore honors student majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Data Science 
            at the University of Hartford. I have been coding since I was little, starting off in Scratch, 
            then moving onto Python and Java. I am now teaching myself HTML and CSS to code this website! 
            I also am an Executive Board member of two clubs, the Society of Women Engineers and oSTEM, as 
            well as being a part of the coding club. I am always looking for new projects to throw myself 
            into to learn something new, whether it be new coding projects, learning cool things about 
            space, or drawing.

                and reading skills. Due to Covid-19, I have transferred to working online as head tutor. 
                When I am not working directly with a student, I grade worksheets. I also 
                assign worksheets based on each students math and reading competency level. <br><br>

            Activity Decider Amazon Alexa Skill <br>
                &emsp; My senior project in high school. I spent several months researching Alexa Skills 
                and learning about how our voice is encoded and interpreted before going on to code my 
                own skill in Python. It randomly pulls an activity from a series of dictionaries 
                when invoked and replies back with that activity. I also wrote a "how-to" guide 
                to explain my process making the skill, learning GitHub, Travis CI, and much more.
