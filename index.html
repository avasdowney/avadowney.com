                    well as a part of the coding club and cybersecurity club I am always looking for new projects 
                    to throw myself into to learn something new, whether it be new coding projects, learning cool 
                    things about space, or drawing.

                                As a TA for a Data Structures course, I attend all classes and help students who are 
                                struggling with code. I also hold office hours outside of class where students can 
                                reach me outside of class time to get clarification and help with material and code. I 
                                also check student work for plagiarism and functionality. <br><br>

                                When I was not working directly with a student, I graded worksheets. I also
