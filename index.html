            <p class = "responsive"> 
                I am a Sophomore honors student majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Data Science 
                at the University of Hartford. I have been coding since I was little, starting off in Scratch, 
                then moving onto Python and Java. I am now teaching myself HTML and CSS to code this website! 
                I also am an Executive Board member of two clubs, the Society of Women Engineers and oSTEM, as 
                well as being a part of the coding club. I am always looking for new projects to throw myself 
                into to learn something new, whether it be new coding projects, learning cool things about 
                space, or drawing.

                            As a TA for a Data Structures course, I attend all classes and help students who are 
                            struggling with code. I also hold office hours outside of class where students can 
                            reach me outside of class time to get clarification and help with material and code. I 
                            also check student work for plagiarism. <br><br>

                            I worked one on one with kids ages three to fifteen on their math 
                            and reading skills. Due to Covid-19, I transferred to working online as head tutor. 
                            When I was not working directly with a student, I graded worksheets. I also 
                            assigned worksheets based on each students math and reading competency level. <br><br>

                            As Underclassman Shadow, I attend all executive board meetings and get a feel of how the

                            My senior project in high school. I spent several months researching Alexa Skills

                            own skill in Python. It randomly pulls an activity from a series of dictionaries 
                            when invoked and replies back with that activity. I also wrote a "how-to" guide 
                            to explain my process making the skill, learning GitHub, Travis CI, and much more.
