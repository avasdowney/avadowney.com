                        2020, and was able to help recruit over 30 new members to the club. 
                    <h3> Student Ambassador, University of Hartford </h3>

                        I am a student ambassador for the University of Hartford College of Arts and Sciences. 
                        I attend events where prospective and new students will be able to ask me questions about 
                        my experience. I have taken over the official University of Hartford Instagram story to 
                        answer questions from both current and prospective students about student life, clubs, and the 
                        University of Hartford computer science program to an audience of over 11,000 people.
                        I also was a panelist for an event put on by the University of Hartford Computing Science 
                        Department. I answered questions from prospective students about what it's like to be a 
                        Computer Science student at the University of Hartford.

                        The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) helps to enable women to have a place in engineering. 
                        I joined SWE in September of 2019, then was elected as underclassman shadow in May 2020. 
                        As Underclassman Shadow, I attended all executive board meetings and got a feel of how an 
                        eBoard works. I also helped the rest of the eBoard with any gaps that needed to be filled. 
                        I also helped to run several successful online and in-person events, such as a NASA Webinar 
                        and a 'Life After College' Q&amp;A session.
