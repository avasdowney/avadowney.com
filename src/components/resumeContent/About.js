                <p>
                    I am a Junior honors student majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in both Mathematics and 
                    Data Science at the University of Hartford. I have been coding since I was little, starting off 
                    in Scratch, then moving onto Python and Java. I now have experience in many more languages such as 
                    Clojure, and JavaScript, as well as many tools and frameworks including Git, Azure DevOps, JupyterNotebook
                    JUnit, TravisCI and more! I am currently working on several project both for myself, and collaborative 
                    projects with my clubs including updating this website, and building Discord bots, just to name a few! 
                    I am always looking for new projects to throw myself into to learn something new, whether it be new coding 
                    projects, learning cool things about space, or drawing.
