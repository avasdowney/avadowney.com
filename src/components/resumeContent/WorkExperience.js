                        Jun. 2022 - Present {<br></br>}
                        I am assisting migration into Snowflake from Microsoft SQL by validating data using 
                        Python. I also assist with report testing in end stages of application development.

                        I worked on several projects such as debugging and adding features to CI/CD pipelines

                        Jan. 2021 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        I was a teaching assistant for a Data Structures course under Dr. Sheikh Islam.
                        I attended all classes and helped students who were struggling with code. I also held 
                        office hours outside of class where students could reach me to get clarification and 
                        help with material and code. I also checked student work for plagiarism and 
                        functionality.

                        I worked one on one with kids ages three to fifteen on their math 
                        and reading skills. Due to Covid-19, I transferred to working online as head tutor. 
                        When I was not working directly with a student, I graded worksheets. I also 
                        assigned worksheets based on each students math and reading competency level.
