                    <h3> Evaluating Fairness in Predictive Policing Using Domain Knowledge </h3>
                        As an increasing number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are ingrained in our day-to-day 
                        lives, it is crucial that they are fair and trustworthy. Unfortunately, this is often not the 
                        case for predictive policing systems, where there is evidence of bias towards age as well as 
                        race and sex leading to many people being mistakenly labeled as likely to be involved in a crime. 
                        In a system that already is under criticism for its unjust treatment of minority groups, it is 
                        crucial to find ways to mitigate this negative trend. In this work, we explored and evaluated the 
                        infusion of domain knowledge in the predictive policing system to minimize the prevailing 
                        fairness issues. The experimental results demonstrate an increase in fairness across all of the 
                        metrics for all of the protected classes bringing more trust into the predictive policing system 
                        by reducing the unfair policing of people. {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                    <h3>Predictive Policing: A Fairness-aware Approach</h3>
                        As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, it is of
                        utmost importance to ensure that they are both fair and reliable. Regrettably, this is not always
                        the case for predictive policing systems, as evidence shows biases based on age, race, and sex,
                        leading to wrongful identifications of individuals as potential criminals. Given the existing
                        criticism of the system's unjust treatment of minority groups, it becomes essential to address and
                        mitigate this concerning trend. This study delved into the infusion of domain knowledge in the
                        predictive policing system, aiming to minimize prevailing fairness issues. The experimental results
                        indicate a considerable increase in fairness across all metrics for all protected classes, thus
                        fostering greater trust in the predictive policing system by reducing the unfair treatment of
                        individuals. {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                        Competition in Hartford, CT to represent the University of Hartford Honors program. I worked 
                        with my team over 48 hours to create a prototype, marketing plan, and sales sheet for our 
                        invention following the prompt "outdoor lifestyle." This show was aired in January,

                        May 2021 - May 2023 {<br></br>}
                        Out in STEM (oSTEM) works on creating an inclusive space on campus for LGBT people and their 
                        allies in STEM. As president, I took the lead on all club meetings and events, as well as was 
                        in charge of the University of Hartford chapters standing with national oSTEM.
                    <h3> Secretary, oSTEM  </h3>
                        Sep. 2020 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        As secretary of oSTEM, I helped with recruitment and paperwork involved in running the club. 
                        I also helped with the clubs founding as it was only brought to my campus in September of 
                        2020, and was able to help recruit over 30 new members to the club. 
                    <h3> Student Ambassador, University of Hartford </h3>
                        Jan. 2021 - May 2023 {<br></br>}
                        I am a student ambassador for the University of Hartford College of Arts and Sciences. 
                        I attend events where prospective and new students will be able to ask me questions about 
                        my experience. I have taken over the official University of Hartford Instagram story to 
                        answer questions from both current and prospective students about student life, clubs, and the 
                        University of Hartford computer science program to an audience of over 11,000 people.
                        I also was a panelist for an event put on by the University of Hartford Computing Science 
                        Department. I answered questions from prospective students about what it's like to be a 
                        Computer Science student at the University of Hartford.
                    <h3> Underclassman Shadow, Society of Women Engineers  </h3>
                        Sep. 2019 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) helps to enable women to have a place in engineering. 
                        I joined SWE in September of 2019, then was elected as underclassman shadow in May 2020. 
                        As Underclassman Shadow, I attended all executive board meetings and got a feel of how an 
                        eBoard works. I also helped the rest of the eBoard with any gaps that needed to be filled 
                        and ran several successful online and in-person events, such as a NASA Webinar and a 'Life 
                        After College' Q&amp;A session.
