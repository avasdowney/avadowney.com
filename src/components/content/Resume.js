                        Jun. 2023 - Present {<br></br>}
                        I am curently working on automating manual workflows using Python, AWS, Terraform, and 
                        Docker, as well as assisting with the cloud migration of data from SQL Server to 
                        Snowflake.

                        I worked with Python to compare Microsoft SQL Server and Snowflake databases to assist 
                        with cloud migration, as well as assisted with report testing in the end stages of 
                        application development.

                        I worked on several projects such as debugging and adding features to CI/CD pipelines

                        Jan. 2021 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        I was a teaching assistant for a Data Structures course under Dr. Sheikh Islam.
                        I attended all classes and helped students who were struggling with code. I also held 
                        office hours outside of class where students could reach me to get clarification and 
                        help with material and code. I also checked student work for plagiarism and 
                        functionality.

                        I worked one on one with kids ages three to fifteen on their math 
                        and reading skills. Due to Covid-19, I transferred to working online as head tutor. 
                        When I was not working directly with a student, I graded worksheets. I also 
                        assigned worksheets based on each students math and reading competency level.

                    <h3> Evaluating Fairness in Predictive Policing Using Domain Knowledge </h3>
                        As an increasing number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are ingrained in our day-to-day 
                        lives, it is crucial that they are fair and trustworthy. Unfortunately, this is often not the 
                        case for predictive policing systems, where there is evidence of bias towards age as well as 
                        race and sex leading to many people being mistakenly labeled as likely to be involved in a crime. 
                        In a system that already is under criticism for its unjust treatment of minority groups, it is 
                        crucial to find ways to mitigate this negative trend. In this work, we explored and evaluated the 
                        infusion of domain knowledge in the predictive policing system to minimize the prevailing 
                        fairness issues. The experimental results demonstrate an increase in fairness across all of the 
                        metrics for all of the protected classes bringing more trust into the predictive policing system 
                        by reducing the unfair policing of people. {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                        Competition in Hartford, CT to represent the University of Hartford Honors program. I worked 
                        with my team over 48 hours to create a prototype, marketing plan, and sales sheet for our 
                        invention following the prompt "outdoor lifestyle." This competition will be aired in January, 
                        2022 on PBS, Amazon Prime Video, and Tubi.
                    <h3> President, oSTEM  </h3>
                        May 2021 - May 2023 {<br></br>}
                        Out in STEM (oSTEM) works on creating an inclusive space on campus for LGBT people and their 
                        allies in STEM. As president, I take the lead on all club meetings and events, as well as am 
                        in charge of the University of Hartford chapters standing with national oSTEM.
                    <h3> Secretary, oSTEM  </h3>
                        Sep. 2020 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        As secretary of oSTEM, I helped with recruitment and paperwork involved in running the club. 
                        I also helped with the clubs founding as it was only brought to my campus in September of 
                        2020, and was able to help recruit over 30 new members to the club. 
                    <h3> Student Ambassador, University of Hartford </h3>
                        Jan. 2021 - Present {<br></br>}
                        I am a student ambassador for the University of Hartford College of Arts and Sciences. 
                        I attend events where prospective and new students will be able to ask me questions about 
                        my experience. I have taken over the official University of Hartford Instagram story to 
                        answer questions from both current and prospective students about student life, clubs, and the 
                        University of Hartford computer science program to an audience of over 11,000 people.
                        I also was a panelist for an event put on by the University of Hartford Computing Science 
                        Department. I answered questions from prospective students about what it's like to be a 
                        Computer Science student at the University of Hartford.
                    <h3> Underclassman Shadow, Society of Women Engineers  </h3>
                        Sep. 2019 - May 2021 {<br></br>}
                        The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) helps to enable women to have a place in engineering. 
                        I joined SWE in September of 2019, then was elected as underclassman shadow in May 2020. 
                        As Underclassman Shadow, I attended all executive board meetings and got a feel of how an 
                        eBoard works. I also helped the rest of the eBoard with any gaps that needed to be filled. 
                        I also helped to run several successful online and in-person events, such as a NASA Webinar 
                        and a 'Life After College' Q&amp;A session.
