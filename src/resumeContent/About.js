            <p>
                I am a Junior honors student majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in both Mathematics and 
                Data Science at the University of Hartford. I have been coding since I was little, starting off 
                in Scratch, then moving onto Python and Java. I now have experience in many languages such as 
                Clojure, and JavaScript, as many tools and frameworks including Git, Azure DevOps,
                React.js and more! I am always looking for new projects to throw myself into to learn something 
                new, whether it be new coding projects, learning cool things about space, or drawing.
