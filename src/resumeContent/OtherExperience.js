                    Through Cybersecurity Club, I am able to further my information security skills by
                    talking to other members of the club and attending events. I participate in capture the
                    flag events, coding competitions, and other cool cybersecurity events. 
                <h3> Student Ambassador, University of Hartford </h3>
                    Jan. 2021 - Present {<br></br>}
                    I am a student ambassador for the University of Hartford College of Arts and Sciences. 
                    I attend events where prospective and new students will be able to ask me questions about 
                    my experience. I have taken over the official University of Hartford Instagram story to 
                    answer questions from both current and prospective students about student life, clubs, and the 
                    University of Hartford computer science program to an audience of over 11,000 people.
                    I also was a panelist for an event put on by the University of Hartford Computing Science 
                    Department. I answered questions from prospective students about what it's like to be a 
                    Computer Science student at the University of Hartford.

                    As secretary of oSTEM, I helped with recruitment and paperwork involved in running the club. 
                    I also helped with the clubs founding as it was only brought to my campus in September of

                    I joined SWE in September of 2019, then was elected as underclassman shadow in May 2020. 
                    As Underclassman Shadow, I attended all executive board meetings and got a feel of how an 
                    eBoard works. I also helped the rest of the eBoard with any gaps that needed to be filled. 
                    I also helped to run several successful online and in-person events, such as a NASA Webinar 
                    and a 'Life After College' Q&amp;A session.
