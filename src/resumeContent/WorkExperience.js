                    Jan. 2021 - Present 
                    As a TA for a Data Structures course, I attend all classes and help students who are 
                    struggling with code. I also hold office hours outside of class where students can 
                    reach me outside of class time to get clarification and help with material and code. I 
                    also check student work for plagiarism and functionality.

                    I worked one on one with kids ages three to fifteen on their math 
                    and reading skills. Due to Covid-19, I transferred to working online as head tutor. 
                    When I was not working directly with a student, I graded worksheets. I also 
                    assigned worksheets based on each students math and reading competency level.

                    I ran the cash register, as well as picked, washed, and graded produce.
